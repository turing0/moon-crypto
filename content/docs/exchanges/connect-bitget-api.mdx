## Update auth_secret variable

The only environment variable that is mandatory is the `AUTH_SECRET`. This is a random value used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes. You can generate one via running:

```bash
npx auth secret
```

Alternatively, you can use the `openssl` CLI, `openssl rand -base64 33`.

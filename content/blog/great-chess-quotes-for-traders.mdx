Great chess quotes from Garry Kasparov that can apply to chess, trading, and daily life.

1. You must know what questions to ask and ask them frequently. Questions are what matters. Questions, and discovering the right ones, are the key to staying on course.
2. The top achievers believe in themselves and their plans, and they work constantly to ensure those plans are worthy of their belief.
3. Personal style is not generic software that you can download. You must instead recognize what works best for you and then, through trial and error, develop your own method- your own map.
4. We must also avoid being distracted from our strategic path by the competition.
5. Play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician, and the endgame like a machine.
6. You may learn much more from a game you lose than from a game you win.  You will have to lose hundreds of games before becoming a good player.
7. Chess is everything: art, science, and sport.
8. By all means examine the games of the great chess players, but don’t swallow them whole. Their games are valuable not for their separate moves, but for their vision of chess, their way of thinking.
9. Steady effort pays off, even if not always in an immediate, tangible way.
10. Everyone must create his own successful combinations with the ingredients he has. There are guidelines for what works, but each person has to discover what works for him. This doesn’t happen by itself. Through practice and observation, you must take an active role in your own education.
11. Success and satisfaction may be our goals, but they can also lead to bad habits that will impede greater success and satisfaction.
12. Choose your move carefully, in chess as in life.
